# Project-Analysis-of-Just-Noticeable-Difference-JND-for-kinesthetic-force

● Built a Machine learning Model which creates a decision boundary for
classification of the greater force of the two forces perceived by the
user using Support Vector machine(SVM) and Logistic regression.
● We have considered several user data with different intervals of time
between forces as input parameters.
● We are analysing the JND for different users at different intervals for all
values of forces.(In progress)
● After that we preprocessed the data , studied the variations of JND
and compared it with the results obtained without preprocessing
● We performed the above results for different users and observed that
results.
